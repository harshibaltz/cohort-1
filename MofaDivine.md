\# Project Name: Sani\_237



\### Project Description

Sani\_237 is a software solution designed to address the persistent waste management crisis in Buea. Drawing from firsthand experience in local cleanup synergies, I observed that temporary efforts often fail without a systematic framework. 



This project provides a digital platform to monitor waste accumulation and streamline management processes, shifting from reactive manual cleanups to a sustainable, technology-driven infrastructure for a cleaner community.
