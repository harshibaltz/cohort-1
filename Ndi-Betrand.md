## Project name: SkillConnect

# Project Description
SkillConnect Cameroon is a two-sided digital marketplace that connects clients in need of skilled professionals such as electricians, plumbers, cleaners, carpenters, and mechanics with qualified, verified service providers in their vicinity. The platform will be accessible via Android and iOS mobile applications built in Flutter, powered by a robust Spring Boot backend.

The platform directly addresses a critical gap in Cameroon's urban economy: a large informal skilled workforce that lacks digital visibility, and clients who struggle to find reliable, vetted professionals. By digitizing discovery, booking, payment, and review of local artisans and professionals, SkillConnect Cameroon will empower workers to grow their income while giving clients fast, trustworthy access to the services they need.
